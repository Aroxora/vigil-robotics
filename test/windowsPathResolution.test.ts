/**
 * Regression: tool path resolution must respect platform-aware
 * absolute-path checks. The earlier `path.startsWith('/')` heuristic
 * was POSIX-only, so on Windows an absolute path like
 * `C:\Users\x\file.txt` slipped through and got `path.join`-ed onto
 * the working directory — producing the doubled
 * `C:\GitHub\milly\C:\GitHub\milly\.vigil\pinned-prompt.txt` we saw
 * in the user's trace.
 *
 * Tests run on whatever OS Jest is currently on, but the assertion is
 * cross-platform because we're checking that whatever path we hand to
 * the tool comes back unchanged when it's already absolute (using the
 * platform's native absolute form).
